    BBLClient provides information and potential data access for the

    the Netherlands (Balgzand) and the UK (Bacton).

    Key Facts:
    - Length: ~235 km
    - Capacity:
      - UK to Netherlands (Export): Up to 7 bcm/year (since 2019)
      - Netherlands to UK (Import): Up to 15 bcm/year
    - Operator: BBL Company (subsidiary of Gasunie)
    - Function: Originally designed for Dutch gas imports into the UK,
      but now operates in both directions.
    
    Usage:
    - Get general information about the pipeline.
    - Fetch live gas flow data (to be implemented using an API).
